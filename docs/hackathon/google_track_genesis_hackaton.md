Gemini is Google’s family of next-generation multimodal AI models capable of understanding and reasoning across text, images, code, video, and audio.



Google AI Studio is a browser-based environment where developers and creators can easily explore and prototype with Gemini models — test prompts, refine outputs, and experiment with different modalities before integrating them into real-world applications through the Gemini API.




Build with Gemini models and Google AI Studio to create AI-powered applications or agents that use multimodal intelligence to automate reasoning, enhance understanding, or streamline real-world workflows.






Participants can explore Gemini through two main options - both include free access:

🌐 Google AI Studio: A free, browser-based IDE for experimenting with Gemini. You can write prompts, test outputs, tweak parameters, and prototype without needing to set up billing or any API keys. Perfect for prototyping and rapid iteration during the hackathon.

💻 Gemini API:  For developers ready to integrate Gemini directly into their apps. The free tier includes a monthly allowance of tokens for text and multimodal inputs/outputs, letting you test and build with Gemini’s core models at no cost. Paid usage only applies for higher-volume or production-level apps.
